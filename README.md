A Spring Boot REST API project that uses Thymeleaf to render the client's current book list and a form for them to add new books. 
Spring JPA is used for data persistence to the embedded Spring H2 server.

## Overview

This project is a companion to the chapter in Craig Walls' 2016 book "Spring In Action". 
You can access the PDF at http://mocom.xmu.edu.cn/home/project/soft/Spring/Spring_Boot.in_Action.pdf. 

## Branches

The main branch corresponds to the code covered in pages 1-40 of the book. As the book is a few years 
old, some of the code has been updated to account for deprecated methods and outdated syntax.
